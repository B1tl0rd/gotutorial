Cmd-Run
==============

This exercise runs an external process. For the ease of exercise, the
external process is just invoking "ls -l $INPUT" where $INPUT is from
the command line arguments (that portion is already supplied).

The goal here is to invoke "ls" and display the output.

You'll be using the os/exec functions:
