config-json
===========

Go has builtin support for parsing json into higher level data
structures. This exercise looks at using JSON for a configuration
store. JSON is extremely flexible, but (in most cases) Go wants
more structure to its data types. You'll be adding that structure
in two ways: map and struct.

You'll be using the encoding/json unmarshal function:

  https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/

Go has other encoding libraries (xml, csv, xml) which behave largely
the same way.

NOTE: You'll be using a pointer operation(&) in part of this, but
you can ignore how that works for now.
